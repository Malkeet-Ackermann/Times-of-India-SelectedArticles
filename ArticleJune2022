SHORT MEMOIR :JOBS BEING INQUISITIVE


Back in Silicon Valley in the autumn of 1974, Jobs reconnected with Stephen Wozniak,
a former high school friend who was working for the Hewlett-Packard Company. When Wozniak told Jobs
of his progress in designing his own computer logic board, Jobs suggested that they go into business together, 
which they did after Hewlett-Packard formally turned down Wozniak’s design in 1976. The Apple I,
as they called the logic board, was built in the Jobses’ family garage with money they obtained by 
selling Jobs’s Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak’s programmable calculator.
